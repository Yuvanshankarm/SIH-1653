## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

1. Personalized Question Bank:
   
  The system generates interview questions tailored to a candidate’s resume, career history, and the job role. It ensures relevant, role-specific questioning, making interviews more engaging and targeted.

2. Dynamic Question Flow:
   
  Questions adapt in real-time based on the candidate’s responses. If answers are detailed, follow-ups get more complex; if brief, the system redirects to ensure clarity and depth.


3. Relevancy Scoring:
   
  The system evaluates answers for clarity, depth, and job relevance using NLP. It assigns a relevancy score to help interviewers objectively assess candidates’ expertise and response quality.

4. Speech & Expression Analysis:
   
  The system analyzes tone, pace, and clarity to assess confidence and communication skills. It also tracks facial expressions to provide insights into engagement, stress levels, and professionalism.


5. Advanced Virtual Interview Environment:
   
  A real-time interactive platform that mirrors in-person interviews with video/audio communication, screen sharing, whiteboards, and document sharing. It supports multiple interviewers, real-time ratings,     
 collaborative commenting, and anonymous evaluations to ensure a fair, unbiased, and well-rounded candidate assessment.
